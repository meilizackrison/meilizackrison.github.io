# NOTES — <two contrasting sites>

## Intent
The first page is a webpage for the Old English poem "The Wanderer" for people who are trying to read it in the original Old English. The second page is a holiday gift guide for people looking for Christmas presents for their incredibly cool college age daughters. 

## AI use

The site

 prototypes/p01-color-typography/ has three pages: index.html (the homepage) and two themed pages, all new, not copies of an earlier Spark.
 A nav on every page links all three pages.
 The homepage explains each themed page’s palette and fonts, with a reason from the theme for each choice, and shows each page’s contrast results.

Color, on each themed page

 Its own palette of 3–5 colors in one format (hex, rgb(), or hsl()), used consistently.
 At least one background beyond plain white: a color, a gradient, or an image with a fallback color.
 Every text/background pair meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text), checked with WebAIM’s contrast checker. The results are on the homepage.
 Color never carries meaning alone: links are distinguishable without color (underline, or similar).

Typography, on each themed page

 One or two web fonts of its own, each with a fallback stack ending in a generic family (serif, sans-serif), loading only the weights it uses.
 Font sizes in rem (or em where it’s relative to the parent on purpose). No px font sizes.
 Body line-height of at least 1.5, and line length kept readable (about 45–75 characters).
 A heading hierarchy that’s clear from the type alone, in a logical order (h1 → h2 → h3).

Every Prototype (all three pages)

 Landmarks (header, main, footer), and CSS in separate files.
 Passes the W3C validator with no errors.
 Focus is visible on every link.
 Readable at 200% zoom (Cmd/Ctrl +): nothing cut off, overlapping, or hidden.
 Linked from your hub under Prototypes. Live pages load.
 NOTES.md covers every section, in your own words. Meaningful commits.
